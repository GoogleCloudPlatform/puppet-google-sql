## Module Description

This Puppet module manages the resource of Google Cloud SQL.
You can manage its resources using standard Puppet DSL and the module will,
under the hood, ensure the state described will be reflected in the Google
Cloud Platform resources.

## Setup

To install this module on your Puppet Master (or Puppet Client/Agent), use the
Puppet module installer:

    puppet module install google-gsql

Optionally you can install support to _all_ Google Cloud Platform products at
once by installing our "bundle" [`google-cloud`][bundle-forge] module:

    puppet module install google-cloud

## Usage

### Credentials

All Google Cloud Platform modules use an unified authentication mechanism,
provided by the [`google-gauth`][] module. Don't worry, it is automatically
installed when you install this module.

```puppet
gauth_credential { 'mycred':
  path     => $cred_path, # e.g. '/home/nelsonjr/my_account.json'
  provider => serviceaccount,
  scopes   => [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/sqlservice.admin',
  ],
}
```

Please refer to the [`google-gauth`][] module for further requirements, i.e.
required gems.

### Classes

#### Public classes

* [`gsql_instance`][]:
    Represents a Cloud SQL instance. Cloud SQL instances are SQL databases
    hosted in Google's cloud. The Instances resource provides methods for
    common configuration and management tasks.
* [`gsql_database`][]:
    Represents a SQL database inside the Cloud SQL instance, hosted in
    Google's cloud.
* [`gsql_user`][]:
    The Users resource represents a database user in a Cloud SQL instance.
* [`gsql_ssl_cert`][]:
    Represents an SSL certificate created for a Cloud SQL instance. To use
    the
    SSL certificate you must have the SSL Client Certificate and the
    associated SSL Client Key. The Client Key can be downloaded only when
    the
    SSL certificate is created with the insert method.
* [`gsql_flag`][]:
    Represents a flag that can be configured for a Cloud SQL instance.
* [`gsql_tier`][]:
    The Tiers resource represents a service configuration that can be used
    to
    define a Cloud SQL instance. Each tier has an associated RAM, maximum
    storage, and list of regions in which the tier can be used. Available
    tiers vary depending on whether you use PostgreSQL, MySQL Second
    Generation, or MySQL First Generation instances.

### About output only properties

Some fields are output-only. It means you cannot set them because they are
provided by the Google Cloud Platform. Yet they are still useful to ensure the
value the API is assigning (or has assigned in the past) is still the value you
expect.

For example in a DNS the name servers are assigned by the Google Cloud DNS
service. Checking these values once created is useful to make sure your upstream
and/or root DNS masters are in sync.  Or if you decide to use the object ID,
e.g. the VM unique ID, for billing purposes. If the VM gets deleted and
recreated it will have a different ID, despite the name being the same. If that
detail is important to you you can verify that the ID of the object did not
change by asserting it in the manifest.

### Parameters

#### `gsql_instance`

Represents a Cloud SQL instance. Cloud SQL instances are SQL databases
hosted in Google's cloud. The Instances resource provides methods for
common configuration and management tasks.

  * EXTERNAL: A database server that is not managed by Google.

##### `connection_name`

  Connection name of the Cloud SQL instance used in connection strings.

##### `database_version`

  creation, a failover replica is created for the instance. The name
  doesn't include the project ID. This property is applicable only
  to Second Generation instances.

##### `instance_type`

  The instance type. This can be one of the following.
  * CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE: A Cloud SQL instance that is not replicating
  from a master.
  * ON_PREMISES_INSTANCE: An instance running on the customer's
  premises.
  * READ_REPLICA_INSTANCE: A Cloud SQL instance configured as a
  read-replica.

##### `ipv6_address`

##### replica_configuration/failover_target
  Specifies if the replica is the failover target. If the field is
  set to true the replica will be designated as a failover replica.
  In case the master instance fails, the replica instance will be
  promoted as the new master instance.
  Only one replica can be specified as failover target, and the
  replica has to be in different zone with the master instance.

##### replica_configuration/mysql_replica_configuration
  MySQL specific configuration when replicating from a MySQL
  on-premises master. Replication configuration information such as
  the username, password, certificates, and keys are not stored in
  the instance metadata.  The configuration information is used
  only to set up the replication connection and is stored by MySQL
  in a file named master.info in the data directory.

  which replication should begin. This can be accomplished by
  setting --master-data to 1 when using mysqldump.

  Interval in milliseconds between replication heartbeats.

##### replica_configuration/mysql_replica_configuration/password
  The password for the replication connection.

##### replica_configuration/mysql_replica_configuration/ssl_cipher

  The service account email address assigned to the instance. This
  property is applicable only to Second Generation instances.

##### `settings`

##### settings/ip_configuration/authorized_networks[]/name
  An optional label to identify this entry.

##### settings/ip_configuration/authorized_networks[]/value
  The whitelisted value for the access control list. For
  example, to grant access to a client from an external IP
  (IPv4 or IPv6) address or subnet, use that address or
  subnet here.

##### settings/ip_configuration/require_ssl
  Whether the mysqld should default to 'REQUIRE X509' for
  users connecting over IP.

##### settings/tier
  The tier or machine type for this instance, for
  example db-n1-standard-1. For MySQL instances, this field
  determines whether the instance is Second Generation (recommended)
  or First Generation.


##### Output-only properties

## Development

### Automatically Generated Files

Some files in this package are automatically generated by
[Magic Modules][magic-modules].

We use a code compiler to produce this module in order to avoid repetitive tasks
and improve code quality. This means all Google Cloud Platform Puppet modules
use the same underlying authentication, logic, test generation, style checks,
etc.

Learn more about the way to change autogenerated files by reading the
[CONTRIBUTING.md][] file.

### Contributing

Contributions to this library are always welcome and highly encouraged.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md][] for more information on how to get
started.

### Running tests

This project contains tests for [rspec][], [rspec-puppet][] and [rubocop][] to
verify functionality. For detailed information on using these tools, please see
their respective documentation.

#### Testing quickstart: Ruby > 2.0.0

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
bundle exec rubocop
```

#### Debugging Tests

In case you need to debug tests in this module you can set the following
variables to increase verbose output:

Variable                | Side Effect
------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
`PUPPET_HTTP_VERBOSE=1` | Prints network access information by Puppet provier.
`PUPPET_HTTP_DEBUG=1`   | Prints the payload of network calls being made.
`GOOGLE_HTTP_VERBOSE=1` | Prints debug related to the network calls being made.
`GOOGLE_HTTP_DEBUG=1`   | Prints the payload of network calls being made.

During test runs (using [rspec][]) you can also set:

Variable                | Side Effect
------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
`RSPEC_DEBUG=1`         | Prints debug related to the tests being run.
