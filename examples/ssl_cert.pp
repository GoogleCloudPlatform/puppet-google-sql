# Defines a credential to be used when communicating with Google Cloud
# Platform. The title of this credential is then used as the 'credential'
# parameter in the gdns_managed_zone type.
#
# For more information on the gauth_credential parameters and providers please
# refer to its detailed documentation at:
#
#   https://forge.puppet.com/google/gauth
#
# For the sake of this example we set the parameter 'path' to point to the file
# that contains your credential in JSON format. And for convenience this example
# allows a variable named $cred_path to be provided to it. If running from the
# command line you can pass it via Facter:
#
#   FACTER_cred_path=/path/to/my/cred.json \
#       puppet apply examples/ssl_cert.pp
#
# For convenience you optionally can add it to your ~/.bash_profile (or the
# respective .profile settings) environment:
#
#   export FACTER_cred_path=/path/to/my/cred.json
#
gauth_credential { 'mycred':
  path     => $cred_path, # e.g. '/home/nelsonjr/my_account.json'
  provider => serviceaccount,
  scopes   => [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/sqlservice.admin',
  ],
}

# TODO(alexstephen): Change this warning and remove the "requires to to exists"
# once a resource reference is added (it will enforce that automatically).
#
# This example requires an instance to exist. You should set
# FACTER_sql_instance_suffix, or use any other Puppet # supported way, to set a
# global variable $sql_instance_suffix.
#
# For example you can define the fact to be an always increasing value:
#
# $ FACTER_sql_instance_suffix=100 puppet apply examples/user.pp
#
# If that instance does not exist in your project run the examples/instance.pp
# to create it, with the same $sql_instance_suffix.
